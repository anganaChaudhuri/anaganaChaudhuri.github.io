title: "Fostering single cell oil synthesis by de novo and ex novo pathway in oleaginous microorganisms for biodiesel production"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper1
excerpt: "This chapter explores biodiesel production using single cell oil (SCO) derived from oleaginous microorganisms such as yeasts, fungi, algae, and bacteria. The major drawback in SCO production is the high cost of the raw material, which further elevates the total production cost. Thus, the utilization of low-cost substrates, such as industrial wastes, can be a promising approach for an economical and sustainable biosynthesis of SCO. Oleaginous microorganisms can utilize both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates in two different biopathways: “de novo” and “ex novo” lipid fermentation, respectively. Besides SCO accumulation, these microorganisms have been extensively focused on their intrinsic capability of synthesizing a variety of high-value by-products such as lipases, biosurfactants, and organic acids. The SCO synthesized by lipid accumulating organisms can be transesterified to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The properties based on the FAMEs profile of the SCO predict its suitability for the production of biodiesel. Moreover, this chapter focuses on the opportunities and challenges of this SCO as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production."
