## Dear Angana

I would like to start off by saying that I love you. I love your company. When I am with you time just flies. I don't have to think about topics to converse, things just take their normal course. When I see you photo in the mornings, it makes the mornings good. When I go to bed, I have dreams. 

I know that I hurt you sometimes. I need to be more careful. When a person you love says something hurtful, it hurts even more. I have hurt you a lot this past week. I have been a very bad boyfriend and it hurts. I want to be the reason you smile. Not the reason who ruins your day. I know you work hard towards your goals. I have seen the struggle. I know that most days I am the one who keeps you up late at night. I know I should take more care of such a precious girl. They don't make them like you anymore. Angy baby don't be angry. Scold me , punish me . But don't be angry na. 

You are the reason I am excited and look forward to days. You are the reason I feel content. Because I know however bad the day goes, you will always be there in the end. Yes sometimes I feel jealous of other guys but its just because I resent that I wanna be that guy who gets to see you and meet you everyday. I wanna hold you in my arms. Its been a long time. I wanna feel your breath against mine. I wanna hold your hand. I wanna kiss you. 

There is no dearth of reasons to love you. You are honest and forthcoming. You dont think my dreams are childish. You are always there when I need you. You make me laugh. You tell me stories. Your eyes gleam when we call. You are excited at little things like me. I can be a child in front of you and you don't have a problem. I love that I am the person who you tell little details about your life. I love the way you blush like you don't say anything but its visible. 

I love you Angy Baby. I love you.
